        <h1>Current Research Projects</h1>
        Here is a summary of the main research projects that the lab is currently working on.
        <h2>Neuroimaging Methods</h2>
        We develop MRI preprocessing and analysis tools such as denoising and segmentation of various brain structures and pathologies.
        <h2>Cerebrovascular & Neurodegenerative Disorders</h2>
        Using the tools that we develop, we study the brain changes that occur in different neurodegenerative disease populations as well as their associations to risk factors, and clinical outcomes.
        <h2>Post-mortem Imaging</h2>
        We acquire post-mortem and histology data of brains with various neurodegnerative disorders, and develop tools to process and analyze these images.
