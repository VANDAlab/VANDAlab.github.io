We are an interdisciplinary research group at the [Cerebral Imaging Centre] (https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/cerebral-imaging-centre/) of the [Douglas Research Institute] (http://douglas.research.mcgill.ca) at [McGill University] (https://www.mcgill.ca) . We investigate the brain changes in aging and neurodegenerative disorders and their relationships to various risk factors and clinical outcomes.
