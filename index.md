# Welcome to VANDA Lab

We are an interdisciplinary research group at the [Cerebral Imaging Centre](https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/cerebral-imaging-centre/) of the [Douglas Research Institute](http://douglas.research.mcgill.ca) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca). We investigate the brain changes in aging and neurodegenerative disorders and their relationships to various risk factors and clinical outcomes.
