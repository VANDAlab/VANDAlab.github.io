# Welcome to VANDA Lab

We are an interdisciplinary research group at the [Cerebral Imaging Centre](https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/cerebral-imaging-centre/) of the [Douglas Research Institute](http://douglas.research.mcgill.ca) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca). Our team investigates the role of cerebrovascular pathology in aging and neurodegenerative disease populations. Our research has three main components:
- Developing neuroimaging and machine learning tools to accurately detect and track signs of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative pathologies
- Investigating the relationship between cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative pathologies, the impact of lifestyle and environmental factors on these diseases, and the impact of cerebrovascular pathology on clinical outcomes in neurodegenerative disease populations
- Ex-vivo assessment of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative pathologies using post-mortem MRI and histology
